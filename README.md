# poker_nn

This code requires recent versions of Tensorflow, Keras, Pandas, Scipy, Numpy, and MatPlotLib. 

After aquiring all of the required libraries, there are two ways to run:

To train a model using the Kaggle poker game data set, execute the "run.py" script.
To train a model using the generated game data, execute the "train_on_simulated.py" script.

You can also run the network tuner by uncommenting one of the three "run_and_tune()" function calls at
the bottom of run.py.
